Hi

I was ask many times on how i made TWRP and how to get it work on Stock Roms.
so i thought i will make a Thread for this, so here we go.

1 TWRP download:
https://1drv.ms/u/s!Am93l3qEx-D_hOdRaTHKVKjvN1M9RA
(this is my Port from the Ulefone S3 , flashing /backup etc all works)

Important:
to get TWRP working you need to edit your fstab in your Rom , it needs to be encryptable insteed of forceencrypt..

How do to this:
well very easy , just follow this steps

1. first you need root! (magsik)

1. Download your Stock rom from Umidigi
2. extract it and take out the boot.img
3. copy the extracted boot.img to your Sdcard or Internal Storage on the Phone
4. Download magisk manager apk from Magisk Thread and install magisk manager apk
5. open it and choose install/ and choose boot.img
6. give magisk your boot.img in your storage
7. after its patched its in your downoad folder
8. copy this patched_boot.img to your desktop on pc

now we need to flash it with flashtools

for this use your scatter.txt file of the stock rom you donwloaded and the patched_boot.img

9. place scatter.txt and patched_boot.img into a new folder created on your desktop
10. rename patched_boot.img to boot.img
11. turn of the phone and start flashtools
12. in flashtools choose the "new folder you created"
13. press on start and after connect the phone to pc via usb..
14. wait. done!
now you have root!
all this steps will take 2-3 minutes.


1. now we need to edit the fstab file
because its a MTK device your fstab file looks like fstab.mt6763 or simliar
2. Download Mixplorer from XDA Thread. ( this root explorer is the best because it set permission automaticly.)
3. open mixplorer and browse to root/system/vendor/etc/fstab.mt6763..
4 open that file and search for ( should be line 15)
Code:

/dev/block/platform/bootdevice/by-name/userdata /data ext4 noatime,nosuid,nodev,noauto_da_alloc,errors=panic wait,check,quota,formattable,resize,forceencrypt=/dev/block/platform/bootdevice/by-name/metadata,

5. edit the file to this
Code:

/dev/block/platform/bootdevice/by-name/userdata /data ext4 noatime,nosuid,nodev,noauto_da_alloc,errors=panic wait,check,quota,formattable,resize,encryptable=/dev/block/platform/bootdevice/by-name/userdata,

6.save and turn off the phone

Flash TWRP with Flashtools

1. now just place the downloaded TWRP recovery to the created "new folder" on your desktop
(where the boot.img and scatter.txt is in)
2. start flashtools choose that folder and press on start
3 connect phone to pc via usb ... wait until its done.
4. congrats you have a working TWRP

Because i dont own this Phone anymore i dont know the button combinations to boot direct into TWRP , but you also can use a playstore app for that , just serch for a advanced power menu in playstore..
